# 2728. Count Houses in a Circular Street

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-houses-in-a-circular-street)

- Constraint: $houses <= k$, which means that it's possible to iterate through
  the street a maximum of $k$ times to know that all houses were covered.

- Akin to counting an array of bits by flipping all of them to 0 and then
  turning one to 1 to start counting.

- Complexity:

  - Time: $O(k)$

  - Space: $O(1)$

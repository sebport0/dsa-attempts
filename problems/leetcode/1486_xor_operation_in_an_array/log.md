## 1486. XOR Operation in Array

- Time: $O(n)$, memory: $O(1)$.

- There is no to create an array to store each $(start + 2 * i)$ value. The
  whole operation, including XOR, can be done in the same iteration that
  calculates each $(start + 2 * i)$ member.

- According to the comments, it can be done in time $O(1)$, but I have no
  idea.
